- Third-party addons can now prevent Adapt from turning their textures into models by adding a "noAdapt" property/keyvalue to the texture (texture.noAdapt=true).

01/21/2016 version 2.1.0
- Rewrote options panel.
- Restructured settings (some with non-standard settings may need to set them back).
- Added new option "With Overlay Mask" to add a circular texture over models to soften the corners and make them more round.
- Added new option "Smaller Portrait" to bring round portraits in even further.
- "Torso Portrait" mode reworked: model turned to "default rotation" and zoomed in just a bit for a more natural view.
- "Full Model" mode zoomed in a bit.
- All animations now (theoretically) use a standing animation without idle animations (such as undead going off camera).
- Fixed camera issue when changing the UI scale or display size.

2.0.7 04/04/13 added blacklist cache, removed debug code
2.0.6 03/30/13 big rewrite: portraits indexed by the texture itself, not the texture name - instead of a frame with back and model drawn off it, back and model drawn straight to parent of original texture - useParentLevel inherited by models - setCamera replaced with SetPortraitZoom - instead of reacting to every SetPortraitTexture, a SetUnit done only if the GUID changed. At the same time, if a UNIT_MODEL_CHANGED happens, every portrait of that unit will be updated at a lower priority update - rebuilt options frame
